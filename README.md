# Practical HTML Project

Welcome to the **Practical HTML Project**!

This repository is a hands-on exercise focusing on HTML, aimed at reinforcing foundational web development skills. It's a simple yet effective way to practice and demonstrate your understanding of HTML structure and semantics.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `index.css`: A CSS file to style the HTML elements.
- `index.js`: A JavaScript file to add interactivity to the webpage.
- `future.jpg`: An image used within the webpage to enhance visual appeal.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Practice writing clean and semantic HTML code.
- Understand the integration of CSS and JavaScript with HTML.
- Create a simple, static webpage as a foundational exercise.
